    "### Q1. Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique that adds a regularization term (L1 penalty) to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.\n",
    "- **Difference from Other Techniques:** Lasso introduces an absolute value penalty on the coefficients, promoting sparsity and automatic feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Advantage of Lasso for Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sparse Solutions:** Lasso tends to produce sparse coefficient vectors, effectively selecting a subset of features.\n",
    "- **Feature Elimination:** Some coefficients may become exactly zero, leading to automatic feature elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Interpretation of Lasso Regression Coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shrinkage Effect:** Lasso shrinks coefficients towards zero.\n",
    "- **Sparse Coefficients:** Some coefficients may be exactly zero, indicating excluded features.\n",
    "- **Magnitude Interpretation:** The larger the non-zero coefficient, the more importance it has in predicting the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Tuning Parameters in Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regularization Parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)):** Controls the strength of the penalty term.\n",
    "- **Alpha Parameter (\\(\\alpha\\)):** Combines L1 and L2 penalties. \\(\\alpha = 0\\) is Ridge, \\(\\alpha = 1\\) is Lasso.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Q5. Lasso Regression for Non-linear Problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primarily Linear:** Lasso is designed for linear problems. For non-linear problems, other techniques like kernelized SVM or decision trees may be more suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Ridge vs. Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Penalty Type:** Ridge uses L2 penalty, Lasso uses L1 penalty.\n",
    "- **Shrinkage Pattern:** Ridge shrinks coefficients towards zero but does not typically yield exactly zero coefficients, while Lasso can lead to sparse solutions with exactly zero coefficients.\n",
    "- **Feature Selection:** Lasso is often preferred when feature selection is desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Lasso Regression and Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Selection's Impact:** Lasso, through its feature selection, can handle multicollinearity by eliminating one of the correlated variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. Choosing the Optimal Regularization Parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation:** Cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, help select the optimal value of \\(\\lambda\\).\n",
    "- **Grid Search:** Systematically searching through a range of \\(\\lambda\\) values and selecting the one with the best performance.\n",
